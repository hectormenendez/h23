v0.0.686 - 20/Mar/09
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

×	All the files, have a die() statement at the beginning of the file, to prevent access
	to it, without the framework being loaded first. It would be nice if that end statement
	would be replaced by some nifty redirection to the 403 template. with correct headers
	of course, oh and by the way... Implement a template handling system for error pages.

×	{DB_Cache::delete()} is called whenever a write type sql statement is queried, it would
	be a nice idea to implement this methodology to fix the bug in {Session} where the temp
	file aren't being deleted. 

×	This is a tough one, {Db_Driver::field_rename()} was removed on this revision due to 
	the fact that MySQL versions previous to 5.1, would remove all the info stored in it.
	I think it's a very important method to ignore it, so in order to re-include it, 
	a quick check for the field to be empty prior any action could prevent the damage and 
	still offer the ability. Another approach could be using temporary data to backup and 
	then after the rename, restore. 

×	I don't like the way {DB_Driver::_identifiers_protect} is coded and used. A check has 
	to be made to simplify this, specially because it makes use of regular expressions and
	I think there are ways to avoid it.

×	In order to simplify the developing of {DB_Driver} all the utility and forge methods
	were merged and declared inside it. Causing a little bloat, It isn't an issue yet, but
	a rollback to the previous methodology could be an option.

×	During the developing of this revision, I felt like the field templates array shouldn't
	be declared on {Core::config} but in a separated file, like the routes. Analize it.

×	{DB_Driver->keys} and {DB_Driver-pkeys} aren't used right now, because it's use hasn't
	been proved as necesary. But a check has to be made in order to ensure this.
	Also, The feeling of something missing with the methodology for handling is high.
	a second check is recommended.

×	{DB_Driver} is missing some utility methods to develop, (table_backup, optimize, etc.)

×	When the user doesn't specify a database name {DB_Driver} shouldn't allow to use the 
	table and field operations. All those methods, must return false.

»	[FIXED] DB_Cache isn't working correctly

v0.0.670
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

×	The Session library doesn't seem to be removing correctly the expired sessions, 
	causing the tmp folder to be flooded with these files. It seems to be a problem with 
	the XML library since after a quick check, some of the variables weren't obtaining the
	correct info from the xml. (I think the xml library needs to be rewritten).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.0.662
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

×	Test the framework in apache for windows prior to vista.

»	[FIXED] Find a secure way to reload the index.php constants so the framework would be 
	available for the inc files as well. 
	[NOTE] index.php was rewritten from scratch.
